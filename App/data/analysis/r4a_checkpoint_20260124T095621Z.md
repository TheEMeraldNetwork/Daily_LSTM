Method summary:
- Target Y: F10_T / A1_T+10; also evaluated 10d forward returns.
- Features used from raw: F10 (predictions), C1 (predictions), A1_prev/A1_T+10 (prices), MA20 & BB %b (prices), optional SPY tape.
- Models/Rules:
  - B1: f10/c1 ≤ 1.03
  - B2 (corrected): f10/c1 ≤ 1.03 AND f10/a1_prev ≥ 1.03 AND %b ≥ 0.60
  - R4a variants: f10/ma20 ≥ {1.02, 1.03}, %b ≥ 0.60, persistence {1of1, 2of3}, tape OFF (and tape tests)

Key results (60d window 2025-11-15 → 2026-01-15):
- B1: trades=2566, cov/day=73.31, hit=0.574, avg10d=0.0141, loss_avg=-0.0548, loss_max=-0.5572
- B2 (1.03): trades=34, cov/day=1.48, hit=0.382, avg10d=-0.0298, loss_avg=-0.0940, loss_max=-0.5515
- R4a θ=1.02 1of1 OFF: trades=2787, cov/day=79.63, hit=0.555, avg10d=0.0142
- R4a θ=1.02 2of3 OFF: trades=2732, cov/day=78.06, hit=0.604, avg10d=0.0228
- R4a θ=1.03 1of1 OFF: trades=2632, cov/day=75.20, hit=0.549, avg10d=0.0143
- R4a θ=1.03 2of3 OFF (R4a_candidate): trades=2556, cov/day=73.03, hit=0.605, avg10d=0.0230, loss_avg=-0.0514, loss_max=-0.5572

Tape tests on R4a_candidate (same window):
- TAPE1 (SPY>SMA200 & %b>0.5): 0 trades (gate OFF during entries)
- TAPE2 (slope(SMA50)>0): 0 trades
- SPY>SMA100: 0 trades
- SPY 5-day thresholds (>0%, >1%, >2%, <0%, <-1%, <-2%): 0 trades each (no overlap with entry days)

Interpretation:
- Best performer in this window is R4a_candidate (θ=1.03, %b≥0.60, 2of3, tape OFF).
- Tape filters tested here remove all coverage in this period; consider different tape definitions, T-1 tape evaluation, or keep tape OFF and introduce an exhaustion guard.

Pending next steps:
- Test exhaustion guard: exclude %b>0.98 at entry; compare drawdown.
- Optional: test tape on T-1 or relative tape (SPY/IEF rising) for non-zero gating.
- Walk-forward stability and sensitivity around θ∈{1.02,1.03,1.04}, %b∈{0.60,0.65,0.70}, persistence∈{1of1,2of3}.
