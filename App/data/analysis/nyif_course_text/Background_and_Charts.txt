Fundamentals
of
Technical Analysis

Day 1
Background and Charts


Course objective

• Learn how to apply technical analysis as a standalone

trading methodology or as a supplement to fundamental
analysis using tools that are based on price action and
other technical principles.

2


Module 1

Introduction

3


Learning objectives

• Understand how technical analysis is an integral part of

market analysis.

• Technical analysis fits into the framework of investment

analysis alongside fundamental analysis and
quantitative analysis.

• Understand what technical analysis is.

4


Investing

• In simple terms, investors seek to buy something that they can sell

later at a higher price.

• The general theory of investing is no different than that of any other

business.

• Investors are buying stocks, bonds, commodities, options, foreign
exchange and other financial instruments because they believe the
price will increase or meet a specific financial goal.

• Bonds may be bought for income.

• Investors will usually buy other financial instruments with the goal of

selling in the future at a higher price.

5


To Know What Everyone Knows Is To Know Nothing

• This idea of “buy low and sell high” is appealing to many investors

so there is significant competition for available profits.

• To find profits, investors analyze available financial information.

• Futurist George Gilder notes, “The source of all wealth is

information.”

• Successful investors all rely on an information edge.

6


Information Is Limited

• All investors have access to financial statements and price history.

• Income statement, balance sheet and statement of cash flows provide 156
pieces of data that can be combined to generate 2,090,365 unique signals.

• Some investors pursue more unique information.

• Discussions with management can be useful despite legal limits on what

management can say under Regulation FD.

• Credit card data can show where consumers spend money and that can be

used to find trends.

• Satellite images of parking lots can offer insights into customer behavior.

7


Satellites Can Count Cars

8


Over Time, the Data Provides Insights

9


Studies Confirm Usefulness of the Data

• Parking lot data is correlated with increases or decreases in same

store sales.

• Same store sales provide insights into earnings.

• Hedge funds use the parking lot data to gain an edge on the

earnings data.

• Technical analysis tools should identify the actions of the large investors

at hedge funds.

10


This Builds on the Difference
Between a Stock and the
Company

11


Many investors Focus on Value

• Extensive efforts have been applied to understanding value.

12


But, Value Is Not Price

Intrinsic value is an elusive concept. In general terms it is
understood to be that value which is justified by the facts, e.g., the
assets, earnings, dividends, definite prospects, as distinct, let us say,
from market quotations established by artificial manipulation or
distorted by psychological excesses.

The market is not a weighing machine, on which the value of each
issue is recorded by an exact and impersonal mechanism, in
accordance with its specific qualities. Rather should we say that the
market is a voting machine, whereon countless individuals register
choices which are the product partly of reason and partly of
emotion.

- “Security Analysis” by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd

13


Shiller’s CAPE Shows Variability of Value

14


All Investors Are Trying to Understand the Same
Equation

P(x) = σ𝑖=1

𝑧 ω ∗ σ𝑘=1

𝑦

ν

where

P(x) = the current market price of x

ω = the current market sentiment related to x
z = number of participants with an opinion on the
sentiment of x
ν = the current intrinsic value of x
y = number of participants with an opinion on the
intrinsic value of x

15


Market Prices Fluctuate Around Intrinsic Value

• Sentiment determines whether the market price is above or below

the intrinsic value.

• Optimism pushes the price above the intrinsic value.

• Pessimism pushes prices below the intrinsic value.

• Technical analysis seeks to understand the nature of the prevailing

sentiment.

• Technical analysis begins with the understanding that the stock will move

between overvalued and undervalued extremes driven by sentiment
related to the company, the market and the economy.

16


The Truth About Value Investing

P(x) = σ𝑖=1

𝑧 ω ∗ σ𝑘=1

𝑦

ν

• Value investors attempt to calculate a stock’s fair value.

• They believe the market price will rarely reflect the fair

value.

• Value investors when buy when price is below fair value.

• Buy when P < ν which means ω is low (bearish).

• Value investors sell to realize a profit when price is above

fair value.

• Sell when P > ν which means ω is high (bullish).

17


Value Investing Depends on Sentiment

• Sentiment is the broadest possible definition of technical

analysis.

• Technical analysis ignores value and focuses solely on the price

action.

18


Formal definition

• Technical analysis is a method of forecasting the direction of

prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and
volume.

The study of market action based on four premises

Market action
discounts the
future

Prices move in
trends

History repeats in
a general manner

Human behavior is
at least somewhat
consistent over
time

19


The study of technical analysis

• In general terms, technical analysts:

• Study charts to uncover patterns

• Apply indicators to identify trends

• Use relative strength to identify potential outperformers

• Study cycles to spot potential turning points in advance

20


Many fundamental ratios incorporate price into
calculations

• Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is obviously dependent on

price.

• Same is true of P/S, P/B, P/CF, etc…

• Dividend yield is determined by price.

dividend amount ($) / current price ($)

• The state of fundamental ratios (overvalued or

undervalued) are understood in terms that are similar  for
technical indicators (overbought or oversold).

21


Fundamental and Technical Indicators Often
Disagree

Rising dividend yield shows increasing value.

As prices rise, value
investors find the stock
more attractive.

22


Assumptions of Technical Analysis

• Price is determined by supply and demand.
• Price discounts everything and the price of the security contains all

the information that’s available about that security.

• Prices move in trends.

• Trends can exist in varying time frames from intraday to multi-year.

• History repeats itself .

• This is because human nature is unchanging -- reactions to internet stocks

in 2000 is similar to reactions to tulip bulbs in 1637.

• Emotional decisions are affected by previous emotional decisions.
• This explains technical concepts like support and resistance, for example,

and behavioral finance concepts like loss aversion.

23


TA Can Be Applied To Free and Liquid Markets

• To apply TA:

• Markets must be free and open, meaning free from

price manipulation and open to informed participants.

• Liquid so buyers and sellers can immediately execute

orders.

• Market data must be widely available.

• Assets are substitutable which means an analysis of the
stock is applicable to all shares of a stock. This is also
called fungibility.

24


Why Technical Analysis Works

• Technical analysis works because prices reflect all available
information and because many market participants make
decisions based on emotions.

• Stock market participants include:

• Traders who are leveraged and will sell on a small decline.
• Long-term value investors accumulating positions over time.
• Long-term value investors with positions they believe they can’t sell

because they’ll face taxes.

• Individual investors with an emotional attachment to the company.
• High frequency traders buying and selling to benefit from market moves.
• Investors who believe the stock represents a special situation.
• Random buyers and sellers.

To Know What Everyone Knows Is to Know Nothing

https://ssrn.com/abstract=3144223

26


Most Traders Already Know How to Win

• Richard Dennis (Turtle Trader):

“I always say that you could publish my trading rules in the
newspaper and no one would follow them. The key is consistency
and discipline. Almost anybody can make up a list of rules that are
80% as good as what we taught our people. What they couldn’t do is
give them the confidence to stick to those rules even when things
are going bad.”

From Market Wizards by Jack Schwager

27


Turtle Trading Legend

• Successful traders Richard Dennis and William Eckhardt held the
turtle experiment to prove that anyone could be taught to trade.

• By the early 1980s, Dennis had turned an initial stake of less than

$5,000 into more than $100 million.

• Dennis believed anyone could be taught to trade while Eckhardt

countered that Dennis had a special gift that allowed him to profit
from trading.

28


The Experiment

• Dennis would find a group of people to teach his rules to, and then

have them trade his ideas with his money.

• The training would last for two weeks and could be repeated over
and over. He called his students "turtles" after recalling turtle
farms he had visited in Singapore and deciding that he could grow
traders as quickly and efficiently as farm-grown turtles.

• Dennis placed an ad in The Wall Street Journal and thousands

applied. Only 14 traders were accepted.

• No one knows the exact criteria Dennis used, but the process

included a series of true-or-false questions.

29


Example Turtle Test Questions

1. The big money in trading is made when one can get long at lows

after a big downtrend.
It is not helpful to watch every quote in the markets one trades.

2.
3. Others' opinions of the market are good to follow.
4.

If one has $10,000 to risk, one ought to risk $2,500 on every
trade.

5. On initiation one should know precisely where to liquidate if a

loss occurs.

30


Example Turtle Test Questions

1. The big money in trading is made when one can get long at lows

after a big downtrend. FALSE

2.

It is not helpful to watch every quote in the markets one trades.
TRUE

3. Others' opinions of the market are good to follow. FALSE

4.

If one has $10,000 to risk, one ought to risk $2,500 on every
trade. TRUE

5. On initiation one should know precisely where to liquidate if a

loss occurs. TRUE

31


Experiment Results

• After training, accounts were funded with $500,000 to

$2,000,000 in 1983.

• Over the next four years, the group delivered an annual average

compound rate of return of 80%.

32


Module 2

Constructing and
Interpreting Charts

33


Learning Objectives

• Identify different chart types including line charts, bar charts,
candlestick charts, point and figure charts and other styles.

• Integrate chart patterns and behavioral finance.

• Apply important charting concepts including trend, support,

resistance, volume and gaps.

34


Patterns Can Be Seen In All Chart
Styles

• Line charts include the least amount of information but just as

useful as other styles.

• Bar charts represent each time period as a bar and add

information about the size of the range (high – low) which depicts
a measure of volatility.

• Candlesticks add a level of detail absent from bar charts by

coloring the candle to show whether the close was up or down
relative to the open.

• Point and figure charts ignore time and show only price action,

focusing on the trend.

35


Different Styles Show the Same Patterns

Which Chart Is Best?

• The answer to any “which is best?” question is always:

• The best one is the one you are most comfortable with.

• Or, the one your client or boss prefers.

• All chart styles can be used productively and sometimes

profitably.

• Profitability will require a disciplined approach.
• To be profitable, a complete trading plan will be needed
defining entries and exits; the plan must be followed
with discipline, taking all trades; and the plan must be
followed for an extended period of time.

Charts are fractal

• Patterns are visible in any time frame.

• The same principles apply in any time frame.

• Trends are often easier to spot in higher time frames

(monthly, for example).

• Prices tend to exhibit mean reversion in the short term

and trending behavior in the long run.

• Indicators can be applied in any time frame.

• This applies to any type of chart style.

Bar charts

• The length of the bar shows the struggle between bulls and bears

during the day.

• The high shows the maximum power of bulls.

• The low shows the maximum power of bears.

43

44


Construction of a candlestick chart

• Each candle shows the price action for one time period (day, week,

etc.).

• The candle consists of a rectangle defined by the open and close

and wicks or shadows which show the high and low. Body is
colored in if the close < open and clear if close > open.

45


Comparison of candlestick charts with other chart
types

• The body of the candlestick adds information not visually available

in other charts.

• The color of the body (black/white or red/green) shows

whether bulls or bears had more power in that time period.

• Candles form patterns quickly, just 1-3 candles in many cases.

• This allows for quick reaction to changes in the trend

• There are no real disadvantages to candlesticks since they include

the same information a bar chart has

• Like a bar chart, candlestick patterns should be confirmed with

volume or other indicators

46


Traditional candlestick chart

47


P&F chart

Uses X for up
trends, O for
downtrends

48


P&F charts

• Xs signify up moves; Os signify down moves.
• Construction based on box size and reversal size.
• Box size is the number of points per X or O.

• Often set to $1.
• Higher values are less sensitive to trend reversals.
• Lower values are more prone to reverse.

• Reversal size is usually 3.

• When price reverses by 3, start a new column.
• If up trend, and price moves down by $3, switch from a

column of Xs to Os.

• If down trend and price rises $3, switch from Os to Xs.

49


Constructing a P&F chart

Prices are in a down trend and the following market action unfolds:

High

Low

15.50

12.90

12.20

11.70

12.60

10.90

10.95

10.75

14.10

11.95

15.99

13.80

15.10

12.00

Day 1

Day 2

Day 3

Day 4

Day 5

Day 6

Day 7

Box size is $1 and reversal size is $3.

50


Day 1

• Prices are in a downtrend which means we are in a column of Os.

So, we look if the price action dictates more Os.

Day 1 High = 15.50 Low = 12.90

We fill in Os to $13.

51


Day 2

Day 2 High = 12.20 Low = 11.70

We fill in Os to $12.

52


Day 3

Day 3 High = 12.60 Low = 10.90

We fill in Os to $11.

53


Day 4

Day 4 High = 10.95 Low = 10.75

Price move is small and no
changes are needed.

54


Day 5

Day 5 High = 14.10 Low = 11.95

There is little downside
movement but, the upside
move allows us to draw 3
Xs.

55


Day 6

Day 6 High = 15.99 Low = 13.80

We fill in Xs to 15.

56


Day 7

Day 6 High = 15.90 Low = 12.00

There is a downside
reversal with 3 Os.

57


Over time, the chart develops more detail

58


Generally P&F patterns are based on breakouts

59


Typical P&F chart: Signals are rare and useful

60


Example: Zoom

61


Example: Lyft

62


Example: GE

63


Other chart types

• While line, bar, candles and P&F are the most popular,

other charts are used.

• Other charts are used by traders seeking an edge.
• Some traders believe they can gain an edge by using

information that other traders are ignoring.

• Note that this might not be correct since we need

trends to actually profit.

• Among the less widely-used chart styles are Renko charts

and Ichomoku clouds.

64


Renko

• Ignores time. Can be used for trend following.

• Useful for end of day, or weekly, trend-following strategies.

• A renko chart is constructed by placing a brick in the next
column once the price surpasses the top or bottom of the
previous brick by a predefined amount (similar to the
reversal amount in P&F charts).

• White bricks are used when the direction of the trend is

up.

• Red bricks are used when the trend is down.

65


Renko chart: Gold $10 per box

Can wait for 3-
box reversal or
trade each
reversal

66


Renko chart: Gold $5 per box

67


Ichimoku clouds

68


Ichimoku is based on moving averages and is
generally as accurate as other MA strategies

69

Full Ichimoku Cloud chart

Five components to a full cloud chart


Five Components of the Chart

• Turning Line – midpoint of the high and low of the last 9 sessions.
• Standard Line - midpoint of the high and low of the last 26 sessions.
• Cloud Span A – midpoint of turning line and standard line shifted

forward 26 bars forward.

• Cloud Span B - midpoint of the high and low of last 52 sessions shifted

26 bars forward.

• The Lagging Line – the price line (close) shifted back 26 bars.”

72


Interpreting Ichimoku Clouds

• Prices above the cloud are bullish.

• Prices below the cloud are bearish.

• Prices in the cloud are bullish if they came from the bullish zone.

• Prices in the cloud are bearish if the came from the bearish zone.

• Historically thick clouds after a run in prices might signal an

imminent trend change.

• The lagging line crossing the cloud is the main signal of a trend

change.

73


Example of using the lagging line as a sell signal

Sell signal came 5.5% below high and
well before bear market was obvious

74


Not All Signals Are That Accurate

• Signals from the lagging line are delayed by 26 weeks

• Although they appear timely on historical charts, you

cannot act on them in real time

• In this case, the action would have been taken in June

when SPY was almost 11% below its high

• Signals from the lagging line are good, but not as good as

they seem to be on historic charts because of the lag

75


Signals Often Lag the Market

By the time you knew the signal occurred,
SPY was 29% above its low

76


Despite limitations, clouds are still useful (turning line &
standard line)


To Focus On Signals Prices Can Be Turned Off

IWM

78


Most Important, Real-Time Information Comes
From Two Lines

• Buy and hold only when the turning line is above the
standard line wins about 48% of the time (vs 61% for
random buy)

• Using SPY, data since May 1, 1999 to April 30, 2019
• Assumes $2.50 per trade in commissions and costs

Important charting concepts for all chart styles

• Trends

• Support and resistance levels

• Gaps

• Volume

81


Trends

Price will always move in one of three directions: up, down
or sideways

• Up trend = a series of higher lows and higher highs

• Down trend = a series of lower highs and lower lows

• Sideways Trend = neutral price action with nearly

parallel highs and lows

Heuristic of representativeness and saliency bias are at
work

82


Trend

• The primary direction of price change is usually easy to determine.

Down

Volume
diverging

Sideways

Up

Volume
confirming

83


Uptrend

• A trend with prices moving higher. An up trend may represent the

primary trend or correction in a primary downtrend

84


Downtrend

• A series of lower highs and lower lows

85


Sideways trend or consolidation

• A trading pattern in which the price movement is sideways rather
than in either an up trend or a down trend. Breakouts might be in
either direction and intermediate term price action can be helpful.

86


Trendline

• An up trendline connects lows; a down trendline connects highs.
• Need at least two touches, ideally three. More touches and greater

length add to significance.

87


Acceleration can be seen in trendlines

88


When is a trendline broken? Rules vary by trader

• Intraday prices can break the trendline and signal time to act.

• Can wait for a close below (or above) the trendline.

• Can require a close below (or above) the trendline for 2 or more

consecutive days.

• Can require a move of 1% or 3% or x% from the trendline.

• Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.

89


Trendline breaks

Stricter requirements can keep a trade open longer.

90


Waiting for confirmation can increase gains

91


Signals can come well after price reversals

92


Examples of trendline violations

Same concepts apply in downtrends.

93


Determining validity of trend breaks

• General guidelines can be developed.

• Is the trend broken on an intraday or closing basis?

• Closing basis is more important.

• Is the trendline steep or gradual?

• Steep trends tend to be less significant.

• What is the timeframe of the chart?

• Longer term trends tend to be more significant.

• Is the break on heavy volume?

• Some analysts use volume to confirm the break.

94


Real world: trendline breaks are not always clean.
Here we have a trendline break and a sell signal

95


Market did not turn down after that trendline break

96


New trendlines can always be drawn but that is not
a guarantee the next break will be a valid trend
reversal

97


Trendlines are ultimately subjective

• Subjective tools can provide different results for different

traders.

• They can also lead to different interpretations of the same

chart by the same trader.

• Trendlines tend to be prone to whipsaw trades.

• A whipsaw trade is a trade that is quickly reversed.
• For example, a price decline breaks a trendline and

prices then quickly resume their rally.

98


Minimizing whipsaws

• Require time confirmation.

• Delay action until the break is confirmed by 1 or more

subsequent closes.

• 3% Rule.

• Wait to act until prices are at least 3% away from the

break.

• Confirmation from indicators.

• Confirm break with moving averages or indicators.

99


Current trend?

100


Does more data add anything to trendline analysis?

101


Example: CAC 40 daily

102


Example CAC 40 weekly

103


Important charting concepts

• Trends
• Support and resistance levels
• Gaps
• Volume

104


Support and resistance

Support: an area where buyers come into the market. Indicates demand

exceeds supply.

Resistance: an area where sellers become more active. Indicates supply

exceeds demand.

Examples of anchoring bias because support and resistance prices are

where a significant number of traders anchored expectations.

105


Support and resistance can combine to form a
trading range

Resistance

Support

106


Market actions determines trading strategy

Buy upside
breakout

107


Resistance in Action

Reported to be a
$4 billion trade.

Closed after second
reversal.

108


These concepts also apply to economic data
because supply and demand constrain many data
series

109


Important charting concepts

• Trends
• Support and resistance levels
• Gaps
• Volume

110


Gaps

• An area on the chart where no trades occur. Called “windows” on a

candlestick chart.

111


Gaps follow news

• Under EMH, gaps show areas where news is announced and it

immediately incorporated into the market price.

• For an up gap, the opening price will be above the previous day’s
high and the low for the day will remain above the previous day’s
high.

• For a down gap, the open will be below the previous day’s low and

the day’s high will remain below the previous day’s low.

112


Gaps signal important market action

• If news explains the gap, traders are signaling new

opinions on the stock.

• An up gap shows enthusiasm and a down gap shows

pessimism.

• The news could be real (such as earnings) or a rumor

(such as a buyout or regulatory action).

• If there is no news, the gap is an emotional response and

could indicate the market is irrational.

• At times, gaps can show changes in market structure as

in 1999 when day traders created gaps.

113


Gap on earnings news for Intel

Many traders are
tempted to buy the gap.
This is the idea that
stocks are on sale after a
drop.

114


Breakaway gap

• One of four types of gaps.
• This describes a gap that “breaks away” from a consolidation

range.

• Breakaway gaps are usually the start of a new trend. This is

especially true when confirmed by volume.

• Demonstrates saliency bias.

115


Gaps can be obvious on charts, but do not always
prove to be tradable

116


Exhaustion Gap

• A gap that comes after a strong move in one direction. It signals

the end of the trend, a loss of momentum, and a likely reversal in
the short-term.

• Buyers are acting on overconfidence and over-optimism heuristics.

117


Runaway Gaps

• Runaway gaps are also called measuring gaps, and are caused by

increased interest in the stock.

• Combines overconfidence and over-optimism.

118


Common gap

• Gaps which occur “routinely” or are “common” in trading.
• Chart below highlights several common gaps with arrows. In this

case, low volume could be the cause of the gaps but the chart
demonstrates gaps are common in this stock and do not identify
important information.

• This is common for ADRs or ETFs of foreign indexes.

119


Example: TSLA

120


Other Factors to Consider: Buy or Short?

121


TSLA Broke Down

122


Important charting concepts

• Trends
• Support and resistance levels
• Gaps
• Volume

123


Volume analysis is a personal choice

• Volume was, at one time, indispensable information.

• This was when market makers on the exchange floor

handled all trades in a stock.

• Changes in market structure make volume less

meaningful.

• In particular, HFT and off floor trading make it almost

impossible to know what the true volume is.

• High frequency trading (HFT) replaces market

making to a degree and their activity to obtain shares
to deliver for trades inflates volume.

• Off floor trading is reported but the purpose of the
activity is unknown and it isn’t known how much is
related to market making activity.

124


Volume analysis can still provide insights

125


Volume can show conviction of traders

The lack of a pullback indicates this was a low risk entry point.

126


Volume analysis can be subjective

127


High volume can show sentiment shifts, but volume
tends to be high on one day selloffs

128


General guidelines for volume

• It take volume to push prices higher.

• Buyers are needed for price gains but prices can fall on

high or low volume.

• Volume tends to taper off during trends.

• This is normal and tells us little.

• Volume tends to spike near bottoms.

• Usual pattern is capitulation low followed by rally on

high volume.

• Volume, by itself, does not provide tradable information.

129


Module 3

Chart Patterns

130


Learning Objectives

• Identify chart patterns on bar charts and candlestick

charts so that trading decisions can be made based solely
on the chart.

131


Chart patterns

• In the early 1900s, traders identified recurring patterns in charts.
• In some ways, this is analogous to the identification of constellations.
• The patterns, in both cases, connect dots that are subjective to the

viewer.

• Chart patterns are often tied to logical explanations.

• This provides an appearance of rationality but can also provide an

appearance of pseudoscience.

• Beginning in the 1990s, patterns were subjected to testing.

• This required strict definitions of patterns.
• Results were mixed to negative.

• But, patterns can still be useful.

• Even if the pattern has a low win rate, the disciplined approach can

avoid large losses.

132


Patterns can be broadly categorized

• Topping patterns.
• Bottoming patterns.
• Continuation patterns.

Before cataloguing patterns, let’s start with an in-depth review of
the concept using a specific pattern.

133


Head and Shoulders Top

• Perhaps the most famous pattern.

• Widely viewed as a precursor of major declines.

• Derives its name from the distinctive shape of the top.
• The chart shows the rough outline of an individual’s

head and shoulders.

134


Head and Shoulders

• A pattern consisting of three peaks. The first and third are the

shoulders, and the middle (second) is the head. Provides a price
target with a measured move.

135


Left shoulder and head are a normal uptrend

As prices move in an uptrend, they form a series of higher highs and higher lows.
The LS and head are simply the two last highs of a normal uptrend.

136


The right shoulder is a failure in the trend

After the head forms, price is still in a defined uptrend. The RS fails to make a
new high, warning that trend is ending.

137


The neckline shows fear of missing out giving way
to fear

Pullbacks in uptrends tend to be viewed as buying opportunities. This explains
support after the LS and head form. A break of that level means buyers over the
time the pattern formed all show losses and their selling pushes prices down.

138


All patterns use the same price targeting technique

Assume a sense of symmetry exists in the market. The height of the pattern
(head to neckline) is used to project the price target.

139


If volume is considered…

• Trades should not be excluded because volume pattern is

not ideal.

• Volume may not include all trading.

• Relative volume is more meaningful than absolute

volume.

• Volume could be normalized as a comparison to its MA.
• This would show whether volume is relatively higher or

lower when compared to recent activity.

140


Topping patterns

• Head & Shoulder Top

• V – Top

• Double Top

• Triple Top

• Rectangular Top

• Saucer Top

141


Head & Shoulder example

142


V-top

143


V-tops are more common in futures markets

144


Psychology of futures differs from stocks

• In stocks, fear rises as prices fall.
• In futures, fear rises as prices rise.

• Fear of missing out on large gains builds as prices rally.
• Anecdotal evidence from gold market: as gold reaches
new highs, public participation in the market increases.
• Advertising for gold buyers increases in media while
local markets see increases in “gold bought here” ads.

• The price rise results in a rush of buyers and a V-top.

• Commodities tend to form V-tops and broad bottoms
while stock markets tend to form broad tops and V-
bottoms.

145


Double Top

• A pattern where resistance is tested, followed by a down side

breakout

146


Double Top

Roughly an M pattern.

147


Triple top

148


Rectangle (top/bottom/consolidation)

• A price pattern marked by a relatively narrow range bound by

support and resistance

149


Rectangles Show Various Biases

• Some investors are making decisions based on the status

quo effect and are doing nothing.

• They may be overconfident in their analysis of the

fundamentals.

• This will always be the case.

• Others are anchoring on recent price action.

• They may be overly optimistic or pessimistic.
• Excessive optimism is shown with buying at support.
• Excessive pessimism leads to selling at resistance.

• Often, it will take news to break the relative balance.

150


Saucer top or rounding top

151


More important than the name is the sense of
symmetry to develop price targets

152


Remember the patterns are not precise and
multiple targets are possible

153


Bottoming patterns

• V-Bottom

• Double Bottom

• Triple Bottom

• Saucer Bottom

• Rectangle Bottom

• Head & Shoulder Bottom

154


V-bottom

155


Double Bottom

• A pattern where support is tested, followed by an upside breakout.

Roughly, a “W” pattern.

Investors anchor on price level of first bottom as a
buy point.

156


Triple bottom

The anchoring at point 3 should be more visible and prices may
not reach the previous lows as buyers jump in.

157


Patterns may not be precise

158


Inverse head and shoulders

• A bullish reversal pattern.

159


Inverse Head and Shoulders

• Trend is driving prices down as investors overcome loss aversion

to sell.

• This is a powerful driver of trends and explains why downtrends are faster

than uptrends.

• Sellers take action all at once while buyers will buy slowly.

• Each new low brings in more sellers, all with orders to sell

relatively quickly.

• The reversal develops in a manner similar to the H&S top with a

normal trend giving way to reversal.

160


Continuation patterns

• Falling Wedge

• Rising Wedge

• Flag

• Pennant

• Ascending Triangle

• Symmetrical Triangle

• Descending Triangle

161


Flags are continuation patterns

162


Pennants are similar to flags, except sloped

163


Triangle (Ascending)

• A bullish continuation pattern. Marked by support which

continues rising and resistance which remains at the same level.
Indicates buyers are entering earlier on pullbacks.

164


Triangle (Symmetrical)

• Also called a coil, a symmetrical triangle is a continuation pattern
found in either an uptrend or a downtrend. It’s characterized by a
narrowing trading range. Resistance trends downward while
support trends upward.

165


Triangle (Descending)

• A bearish pattern representing a period of period of distribution.
Although the descending triangle may provide reversal after an
uptrend, it is most often a continuation formation.

166


Falling Wedge

• A bullish pattern characterized by a decreasing range trending

downward

167


Rising Wedge

• A bearish formation that starts with a wide range that narrows. As

the range narrows, prices rise.

168


Miscellaneous patterns

• Important features of patterns include

• Island reversal

• Breakouts

• Failed patterns

• Narrow range days

• Wide range days

169


Island reversal top

Gap up followed by gap down, leaving an “island” at the top.

170


Island reversal bottom in Dow during 1991 Russian
coup

171


Breakout

• At the completion of a pattern, prices “break out”
• A breakout could be to the upside or downside

172


Failed Pattern

• An indicator pointing to a change that does not materialize

The most powerful signal is a failed signal.

173


Narrow-Range Day

• A day when the range (Range = High – Low) is less than the range

of the previous day

A narrow range often occurs before an increase in volatility

174


Wide-Range Day

• A day when the range (Range = High – Low) is greater than the

range of the previous day

WR Day

W

A wide range often occurs before a decrease in volatility

175


Strategy for Trading Charts

• Identify opportunity based on the pattern.
• Determine profit potential and risk.
• Consider using stop orders to enter positions.

• Plan exit.

• Can exit at target or initial risk point.
• Can use a trailing stop.

176


Example: Building a Trading Plan

Can enter a trade to but at a new high, or short a
break of support. Risk the midpoint of the range
(about $263).

Reading candlestick charts

• Candlestick patterns often consist of one to three candles.

• Because they form in such a short time, they should only be used

for short-term analysis.

• Patterns are often given descriptive names.

• Three black crows, tweezers and homing pigeon are examples.
• Three black crows are three down days that follow an uptrend.
• Tweezers form when two bars have the same high or low but the

trend reverses.

• Homing pigeon is a narrow range bar with a down close following

a wide range bar with a down close.

• Like with traditional patterns, names are not as important as the

general outline.

• Three consecutive down days after an uptrend signals a reversal.
• Support or resistance indicate the direction of the trend could

change.

• Narrow range forecasts increased volatility.

190


General characteristics of patterns

• Size of the body can offer insights about the strength of the price

move.

• Long candles can show strength of traders’ convictions.
• Short candles show indecision.

• Color of the candle shows direction of trend.

• Black or red candles are bearish.

• Size of the wicks can provide insights.

• The longer wick could be thought of as pushing the candle.
• Long tail below the body is pushing up, for example.

191


Six basic candlesticks: Long, Short, Doji

Gravestone is bearish
Dragonfly is bullish

192


Six basic candlesticks: Long Shadows, Long upper
shadow only, Long lower shadow only

Indecision

Bearish

Bullish

193


• The last bar is a long body and indicates the close was below the open.
• Bearish implications for next day.

194


• The next day, a small body indicates indecision.
• The lower wick is noticeably longer.

• Bullish implications for next day.

195


• The next day closed lower, but volatility continued to fall as indicated

by the small size of the candle body.
• The wicks appear to be almost equal.

• There are no real implications for next day’s direction, but, the

narrowing ranges indicate volatility is likely to increase. Consider
trading the breakout.

196


• This chart jumps ahead two days and shows the breakout did occur, to

the downside.

• The long lower wick forecasts limited downside but the large body

reveals strength in the down move. Odds favor further downside after
the breakout and series of bearish days.

197


• This chart jumps further ahead and shows

• The long lower wick forecasts limited downside but the large body

reveals strength in the down move. Odds favor further downside after
the breakout and series of bearish days.

198


Analysis of candles tends to be subjective

• Traders often seek to identify patterns on charts.

• This can be useful if applied consistently and with discipline since many

patterns do show a small trading edge.

• However, because the patterns can be defined, analysis could be

quantitative.

• A bearish three line strike pattern, for example, consists of four

candles:
• Today:

199


Bearish three line strike

• Best candlestick pattern in backtesting.
• Prices close higher within 3 days 81% of the time.

• Can be defined as

Close > Open and Close > Close[-1] and Close [-1] < Open [-1]
and Close [-1] < Close [-2] and Close [-2] < Open [-2]
and Close [-2] < Close [-3] and Close [-3] < Open [-3]

Trading Charts

• Remember that bar charts or line charts offer longer term

opportunities than candlesticks.

• Line charts can offer an uncluttered longer term perspective.

• Chart analysis should be used as part of a strategy.
