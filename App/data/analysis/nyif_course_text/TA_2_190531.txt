Moving Averages (MAs)

• A moving average (MA) is simply an average that moves.

• A 200-day MA uses the last 200 days of data.

• Any time period could be used. The average could use

daily, weekly, monthly or intraday data.

• To calculate a daily MA, the oldest data point is discarded

each day and the newest data point is added to the
calculation.

• The data used in the calculation “moves” with the market

action.

6


Why Use a Moving Average?

• MAs are used to identify the direction of the trend.

• By definition,

• When prices are above the MA, the trend is up.
• When prices are below the MA, the trend is down.

• With a long-term MA, you are guaranteed to be on the

right side of major trends.

Whipsaw trades

• Whipsaw trades are trade signals that are quickly

reversed.

• They usually result in small gains or losses.

• There can be several whipsaw trades in rapid

succession.

• Whipsaws increase trading costs and add frustration.

• Can make it difficult to follow an MA trading strategy.

10


To address whipsaw trades, traders searched for an
edge

• The standard MA is the simple MA which adds up the data

and divides by the number of data points.

• Each data point is assigned equal weight.

• Weighted MA calculations assign different importance to

data points.

• Exponential MAs are front-weighted and assign more

weight to most recent data.

• Back-weighted MAs assign more weight to older data.
• Triangular MA emphasizes data in the middle.
• Adaptive MA varies the weighting using a formula to

assign multipliers.

11


Exponential MA (EMA)

• EMAs use a weighting factor (WF) found with the following

formula, using a 10-day EMA as an example.

WF = (2 / (Time periods + 1) ) = (2 / (10

+ 1) ) = 0.1818 (18.18%)

(Close * WF) + (EMA(previous day) * (1-WF))

• If close today is $11 and the previous EMA was $10,

($11 * 0.1818) + ($10 * (1-0.1818))
= $1.9998 + ($10 * 0.8182)
= $1.9998 + $8.182 = $10.1818

12


Back-weighted MA

• Can also overweight older data relative to more recent

data.

• This minimizes the impact of short-term reversals that

often occur after large price spikes.

• For example, in a 10-day WMA, each of the first 9 days
could be weighted by 10.125% and the most recent day
carries just 8.875% of the weight.

• In a simple MA, each day would carry a 10% weighting.

13


Other MAs

• Triangular: over-weights data in the center.
• Particularly useful for finding cycles.

• Geometric: uses the nth root of the product of n data

points.

• Not particularly useful for trading but useful to

combine varying fundamental data series.

• Adaptive: adjusts to data and tends to deliver an excessive
number of whipsaw trades in range-bound markets but
works well in trending markets.

14


15


Which type of MA is best?

• Defining best as the most profitable.

▪ Testing the 200-day MA on S&P 500 from 1928 to April 2018,

ignoring trading costs.

16


Can any MA beat the market?

• Test all MAs lengths from 5 days to 252 days.

• 61, 504 individual tests.

• Enter and exit rules can be asymmetric (for example, exit
on break below 5-day MA and enter on break above 10-
day MA).

• This test includes all MA crossovers, including the “golden
cross” of 50-day rising above 200-day, “death cross” of
50-day falling below 200-day and other popular
combinations.

17


Data mining MAs

• Best strategy provided 76% of the buy and hold gains and 56% of

combinations were profitable.

• Most importantly, 54% of the combinations reduced risk.

• This is the value of MAs.

• They reduce risk by exiting during market declines.

• This indicates they could be combined with another

indicator to manage risk.

18


Because MAs cannot beat the market, traders
developed more indicators

• Trend - Moving Averages, MACD, ADX, Parabolic.

• Momentum - RSI, Stochastics.

• Volatility - ATR, Bollinger Bands.

• Volume - OBV, Money Flow.

• Breadth – advance-decline line, McClellan Oscillator.

• Sentiment – VIX, Surveys.

19


Indicators Address Problems with MAs

• All MAs will lag the market action.

• This leads to delayed signals.

• All MAs will suffer from whipsaws.

• This leads to multiple losing trades.

• A typical win rate for MA strategies is about 40%.

21


Most indicators are designed to identify momentum

• Momentum in a stock price is the change in its price.

• Can be calculated over any time frame.

• Most general formula:

P / Po – 1

Price divided price (some time ago) minus 1 to

express it as a percentage

• As an example, that formula could be used to compare the

current close with the close six months ago.

22


Many indicators attempt to improve that formula

• Traders are always seeking an edge.

• This led to innovations in moving averages and that

same strategy is applied to indicators.

• Most indicators will use the closing prices and attempt to
improve the timeliness or effectiveness of the signal in
some way.

• RSI seeks to improve on the fact that simple momentum is

unbounded and therefore signals will not be clear.

• This indicator addresses perceived infectiveness of the

simple formula.

23


RSI

• A momentum oscillator that measures recent price movement to

determine when conditions are overbought or oversold.

• Developed by J. Welles Wilder in his book, New Concepts in

Technical Trading Systems (Trend Research, 1978).

• Uses a series of EMAs to find RSI.
• The formula for RSI is:

100 – [ 100 ÷ (1 + { U ÷ D})] = RSI

where:

U = average of days closing higher (up) over a set period
D = average of days closing lower (down) over a set period

(the set period used in most RSI calculations is 14 days)

• Ranges from 0 to 100 with values below 30 oversold and above 70

overbought.

• Also interpreted with divergences and trendline breaks or pattern

analysis.

24


RSI example

25


Traditional interpretation of RSI

• Overbought and oversold levels are defined as:

• Above 70 is overbought which is interpreted to mean

avoid buying or sell.

• Below 30 is oversold which is interpreted to mean the

stock is due for a bounce and is a buy candidate.

• Wilder also explained that RSI can be interpreted with

chart patterns, trendlines or divergences.
• This is subjective and difficult to test.

• Proof in his book consisted of several charts showing well-

selected examples

26


Testing RSI as an OB indicator

• Testing an overbought RSI with default parameters:

• Buy when RSI > 70
• Sell after a predefined # of days
• Test on S&P 500 stocks
• Deduct $5 in commissions for each trade

• Using traditional interpretation, expect to see a loss since
RSI > 70 identifies a time when the stock is overbought
and is expected to decline.

28


Results for overbought signals with 14-day calculation

• On average, stocks go up after they become overbought.

• Result confirms fact that stocks trend and high

momentum is likely to be a sign of a trend as a reversal.

• Remember that the standard interpretation is to sell when

RSI moves above 70.

• Using RSI to avoid overbought stocks would result in

missing almost all big winners.

29


Testing an oversold RSI(14)

• We find stocks also go up after RSI becomes oversold.

Rules:
- Buy when RSI < 30
- Sell after X days. No other exit rules.

30


RSI(14) conclusions based on testing

• RSI(14) does not provide information that allows you to

trade effectively in the short-term.

• Selling stocks with high RSI, the traditional application

of the indicator, will underperform the market.

• When RSI is low, stocks also tend to rally indicating

RSI(14) offers little, if any, useful information.

• RSI(14) should not be used as an overbought/oversold

indicator.

31


Can RSI be fixed?

• Short-term traders can use a shorter calculation period; using less

than 5 bars in the calculation makes the indicator more
responsive.

RSI(2) is a popular short-term indicator and that can be tested.

Conclusions on RSI

• RSI shows little value as a mean reversion indicator.

• This is the standard use for the indicator.

• Extreme values of RSI(2) can provide trade signals.

• RSI(2) < 5 and RSI(2) > 99 provides a tradable edge.

36


Stochastic Oscillator

• A widely used momentum oscillator popularized by George Lane
that shows the location of the close relative to the high-low range
over a set number of periods:

%K = (Current Close - Lowest Low)/(Highest High - Lowest Low) *
100
%D = 3-day SMA of %K

• Traded with crossovers (%D is faster than %K so buy when %D >

%K and sell when %D < %K).

• Or, use at extremes with overbought above 80 and oversold less

than 20.

37


Stochastic oscillator example

38


Market psychology explains the stochastic

• The high of any period shows the maximum power of bulls

during that time. The low of that period shows the
maximum power of bears.

• Stochastic measures the capacity of bulls or bears to close

the market near the upper or lower edge of the recent range.

• When prices rally, markets tend to close near the high. If

bulls can lift prices during the day but can't close them near
the top, Stochastic turns down. It shows that bulls are
weaker than they appear and gives a sell signal.

• Daily closes tend to occur near the lows in downtrends.

When a bar closes near its high, it shows that bears can only
push prices down during the day but cannot hold them
down. An upturn of Stochastic shows that bears are weaker
than they appear and flashes a buy signal

39


Buy and sell signals generated from the Stochastic

• Overbought and Oversold:

• Use 80/20 as key levels

• Can wait for crossover after the indicator becomes

overbought or oversold.

• Alternatively, don’t buy when Stochastic is overbought,
and don't sell short when it is oversold. This rule filters
out some bad trades.

40


Trading with the stochastic

• Divergences: often called “the most powerful buy and sell

signals”

• A bullish divergence occurs when prices fall to a new

low, but Stochastic traces a higher bottom than
during its previous decline. When Stochastic turns up
from its second bottom, it’s a strong buy signal. The
best buy signals occur when the first bottom is below
20 and the second above it.

• A bearish divergence occurs when prices rally to a
new high, but Stochastic traces a lower top than
during its previous rally. As soon as Stochastic turns
down from the second top, it gives a sell signal. The
best sell signals occur when the first top is above 80
and the second below.

Testing divergences on SPY

• On daily chart, since 2000:

• Bullish divergences resolve to the upside 58.9% of the

time.

• Bearish divergence short trades are winners about 40%

of the time.

• On weekly chart, since 2000:

• Bullish and bearish divergences both result in losses.

• Trading rules: divergence exists for at least 5 bars and the

trade is closed 4 weeks after the signal.

• Bottom line: divergences are not tradable.

47


Rate of Change (ROC)

• This is a simple momentum indicator.

• Compares price to the price some time ago:

P / Po

• Can be expressed as a percentage:
((P / Po) – 1 )* 100.

• Often used as the basis of relative strength calculations.
• Can be used as a standalone indicator.
• Can be used as part of an momentum strategy.

48


Absolute Momentum

• Calculate 1-year ROC

• If > 0, buy. If < 0, hold cash or alternative investment like AGG.

A long track record

• Antonacci attributes this idea to

“Some a Posteriori Probabilities in Stock Market
Actions” (Alfred Cowles with Herbert E. Jones),
reprinted in Econometrica (July 1937), 5(3): 280–294.

• Antonacci applies this work to asset classes only:

• US stock market averages
• International stock market averages
• Sectors
• Bonds
• Commodity indexes

60


MACD Indicator

• More formally, the Moving Average Convergence-Divergence

indicator.

• It’s a momentum indicator that uses two moving averages (MAs).

• Shows the convergence and divergence of the MAs.

• Originally developed in the late 1970s when technical analysts
were focused on finding new ways to use exponential moving
averages (EMAs).

• The responsiveness of the EMA to the price action was considered a key to

developing timely signals.

61


Calculating MACD: Add MAs to Prices

Uptrend when
the fast MA is
above the slow
MA.

62


Calculating MACD: Find the MACD Line

Subtract the value of the 26-period
MA from the value of the 12-period
MA.

Value above zero
indicates an uptrend.

Value below zero indicates
slow MA above fast MA.

63


Calculating MACD: Add the Signal Line

The signal line is
a 9-period MA of
the MACD line.

Sell when MACD crosses below signal line.

Buy when MACD crosses
above signal line.

64


Calculating MACD: Add the Histogram

Histogram is found by
subtracting MACD line from
the signal line.

Buy signal when fast
line is above slow line.

65


MACD Basics

• Trade signals generated by crossovers of the MACD line and the

signal line, which is the MA of the MACD line.
• Can also be applied with divergence analysis.

• Divergences should work based on logic.
• If MACD is falling while prices are rising, traders are not working hard

enough to sustain the uptrend.

• If MACD is rising while prices are falling, traders are working hard to stop

the decline, and the downtrend should end soon.

Is MACD Worth Using?

• Monthly or weekly MACD can be used to reduce risk.

• Stop buying stocks, or increase cash when MACD on major market

averages is bearish.

• Can also add put options when MACD is bearish.

• As a standalone indicator, it is not tradable on daily or weekly

data.

• Monthly data could be used as a complete, long-only trading strategy.

71


Bollinger Bands

• Bands drawn 2 standard deviations above and below a 20-

period moving average.

• A measure of volatility where volatility decreases as Bands

narrow and expands as Bands widen.

• In theory, two standard deviations should contain 95% of

the data points.

• In practice, the Bands contain about 90% of the price

action.

• This is useful to know since it tells us a break of the

Bands is unusual and relatively rare.

72


Bollinger Bands

73


Interpretation

• Per Bollinger,

• High volatility begets low volatility and vice versa.

• Some traders expect reversals at Bands.
• Buy at lower Band, sell at upper Band.

• Some traders expect continuation on a break of a Band.
• Buy on a break of the upper Band, short breaks of the

lower Band.

• This is especially true in commodities.

74


Can be used as a trend following strategy. Shown
below: crude oil, Bands = 16 weeks (80 days)

75


A strategy for futures

• Futures are ideal for technical traders because they are

largely technical markets.

• Many traders in these markets use only technicals and

ignore the fundamental data.

• Futures are liquid and are leveraged which can boost

returns.

76


Entry and exit rules

• Use Bollinger Bands with parameters set to  80 days, 2

standard deviation.

• Open long position when close > upper Band.
• Close long when close < 80-day MA.
• Open short position when close < lower Band.
• Close short when close > 80-day MA.

77


Position sizing

• Fixed percentage risk sizing algorithm, risking 5% of the

account on any trade.

• With a $100,000 account, risk is 5%, or $5,000, on any

trade.

• Example, a buy signal in gold. Gold is at $1,200 and the

MA is at $1,175. The MA is the exit signal.

• For gold contracts, each $1 move is a $100 change in

value and the MA is $25 below the entry, so $2,500 is at
risk per contract.

• $5,000 risk allows for trading 2 contracts.

78


For testing, eight contracts are used

• Crude oil
• Copper
• Cotton
• US dollar futures

• Sugar
• Cattle
• Five-year Treasuries

81


Which Indicator Is Best?

• After reviewing and testing various indicators, it’s

reasonable to ask which one is best.

• The answer is, to use the one or two that a trader believes

work the best.

• Most indicators do not hold up to testing.

• Most indicators provide redundant information.

• This is why just one or two is all that is needed.

Academic Research Shows Indicators Work
Sometimes

• An Anatomy of Trading Strategies by Conrad & Kaul; The
Review of Financial Studies, Volume 11, Issue 3, 1 July
1998, Pages 489–
519,https://doi.org/10.1093/rfs/11.3.489

“In this article we use a single unifying framework to
analyze the sources of profits to a wide spectrum of return-
based trading strategies implemented in the literature. We
show that less than 50% of the 120 strategies implemented
in the article yield statistically significant profits and,
unconditionally, momentum and contrarian strategies are
equally likely to be successful.”

84


Detailed findings

• A momentum strategy is usually profitable at the medium

(3- to 12-months) horizon.

• This is a trend following approach and is also called

relative strength.

• A countertrend strategy nets statistically significant profits

at long horizons, but only during the 1926–1947
subperiod.

• This was a trading range and demonstrates oscillator
based strategies have the potential to work at times.

Other Technical Indicators

87


Learning Objectives

• Sentiment (CBOE volatility index (VIX), surveys, insider

buying and selling).

• Breadth (advance decline, % stocks above a moving

average).

88


Sentiment Indicators Take the Pulse of Market Participants

• When the market moves to an extreme, analysts usually

attribute it to fear or greed.

• Fear increases in bear markets.
• Greed dominates in bull markets.

• Sentiment indicators attempt to measure the level of fear

and greed.

• Extremes in sentiment are expected to occur at market

turning points.

89


Sentiment Indicators

• Sentiment indicators measure whether various groups feel bullish

or bearish about the markets.

• Some sentiment indicators are based on polls:

• American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) Sentiment

Survey.

• Investors Intelligence Advisors Sentiment reports.

• Others are calculated:
• Put/Call ratio.
• VIX.
• Margin debt.
• Short Interest Ratio.

90


Interpreting Sentiment

• Sentiment is a contrary indicator.

• When there are too many bulls, there aren’t many

investors left to buy and prices should be near a top.

• Too many bears indicates many investors have taken
losses and there should be reduced selling pressure.

• Extremes in sentiment indicators often mark important

turning points in the markets.

91


Cautions Regarding Surveys

• Watch what investors do rather than what they say.

• Investors may say they are bearish but be buying. Their

buying is more important than their statements.

• Surveys have small sample sizes.

• Are often “opt in” surveys rather than a statistically

valid sample.

• Interpretation tends to be subjective.

• Trades are signaled when it’s assumed too many

investors are one side of a market.

92


VIX Index May Be the Most Widely Followed
Sentiment Indicator

• The VIX index is widely known ad the “fear index” because it rises

when markets decline and fear rises.

• It is calculated with the implied volatility of short-term option on

the S&P 500.

• VIX rises when put option buying increases and falls when call

buying activity increases.

93


VIX Can Used to Forecast Expected Volatility

• A VIX of 22 translates to implied volatility of 22% on the

S&P 500. This means that the index has a 68.2%
probability (one standard deviation) of trading within a
range that’s 22% higher and lower than its current level
over the next year

• To find monthly volatility, divide VIX by square root of

12 (3.464) to get 6.35%, in this example.

22 / 3.464 = 6.35%

• To find daily volatility, divide VIX by square root of 252

(15.874) to get 1.39% in this example.

22 / 15.874 = 1.39%

94


VIX Can Be Used to Calculate the Expected 30-day
Move in the S&P 500

• VIX is telling us whether or not

traders expect volatility and can be
used to find the expected price
change over the next 30 days.

• If VIX is 3.46, there is a 68.2%

probability of a 1% price move over
the next 30 days.

95


A Rough Approximation

• As a rough guide, traders take the level for the VIX and
divide it by 16 to get a quick estimate how large a daily
move is expected in the stock market based on the level of
the VIX.

• Remember, expected daily move was found using the

square root of 252 or about 15.87.

• Traders can round this up to 16 for the denominator.

• VIX of 16 would indicate S&P 500 index options are

pricing in a daily price move of 1% (16/16).

• VIX of 32 would be interpreted as the S&P 500 option
market anticipating a daily price move of 2% (32/16).

96


VIX Is Reacting To the Market Action

• High VIX is a response to high market movement.

• Large selloffs generally lead to increased demand for

put options and the increased demand results in higher
prices leading to higher IV and higher VIX.

• When markets rally, there isn’t usually an increased

demand for call options. Therefore when the market is
rising, there is rarely dramatically higher option
purchasing.

• This is why VIX drops as markets rise.

97


Volatility signals can be part of a market forecast

• Rising VIX expect a selloff.
• Declining VIX expect a rally.

• Buy signals are given when VIX peaks.

98


Limits of VIX Spikes

• No way to know in real time when VIX has actually

topped.

• Spikes are only visible in hindsight.

• VIX strictly applies only to the S&P 500.

• Calculated using data from options contracts on S&P

500.

• VIX does not apply to individual stocks.
• The majority of stocks will move with the market trend

but some will not.

• The same is true for international stocks which have a

high, but imperfect correlation to the S&P 500.

99


VIX Is Not a Timing Tool

• There is no way to know when VIX is “high enough” to

signal a market bottom.

• VIX was not designed to be a timing tool.

• It measures expected volatility.
• Expected volatility is not a directional indicator.

• To trade based on VIX a timing strategy would need to be

developed (e.g., combine with an MA).

• With a timing strategy, VIX could be used to trade the S&P

500 but could not directly be applied to anything else .

100


VIX Flip Indicator Overcomes Limits of VIX

• Approximates the values of VIX by taking a comparing the

close to recent highs and lows.

(Highest (Close, 22) - Low) / (Highest (Close, 22)) * 100

Highest (Close, 22) = highest close in last 22 periods
Low = current low

101


VIX and VIX Flip

102


VIX Flip Is Versatile and Adaptable

• VIX Flip can be applied to any stock or ETF.

• Finds the right stock at the right time rather than

providing a signal about the broad market.

• Can be applied in any time frame (intraday, daily, weekly

or monthly).

• Can be incorporated into a complete trading strategy.

103


VIX Flip Trading Strategy

• Add a 26-week moving average to the VIX Flip indicator.
• Buy when indicator < MA and the stock and S&P 500

are both above their 200-day MA.

• Sell when indicator > MA or when the trade has been
open 8 weeks and shows a loss or when the stock or
S&P 500 closes below its 200-day MA.

• The absolute value of the indicator is not important. The
position of the indicator  relative to the MA is what we
trade.

104


Rationale for Trading Rules

• VIX Flip mirrors VIX so when VIX Flip is high, fear is

high.

• We want to buy when fear is high because we expect a

bottom in price at that time.

• Adding an MA to the indicator provides us with timing

signals.

• When VIX Flip > MA, fear is higher than average.
• When VIX Flip falls below the MA, we have a signal that

fear is subsiding.

105


Rationale for Trading Rules (continued)

• Selling when the trade is open for 2 months without a
profit frees up limited trading capital for additional
opportunities.

• Avoids dead money and also avoids large losses.

• Using the MA filters means we are buying dips in long-

term uptrends.

• This is a quantified approach to the popular dip buying

philosophy.

106


Can’t We Just Add an MA to the VIX?

• Yes, but…

• The buy signal from VIX and the MA would be

applicable to the broad stock market.

• Using VIX we would be getting a signal to buy or sell all

500 stocks in the index at one time and that’s not
practical for any individual trader.

107


Testing the VIX Flip Strategy

• Using weekly data.

• This is a time frame that any individual could find time

to trade in.

• More active traders could use daily data.

• Applied to the individual stocks in the Dow Jones

Industrial Average.

• These are very liquid stocks which means options could

be used.

• Test period: 4/1/1998 through 4/30/2018.
• Deduct $5 per trade for commissions and trading costs.

108


Test Results

• Win rate: 47.6%

• Average annual total return: 11.0%

• S&P 500 average annual total return = 6.5%

• Max drawdown: 11.6%

• S&P 500 max drawdown = 55%

• Invested about 35% of the time so traders can use other

strategies the rest of the time.

109

110


Trading the VIX Flip Strategy

• The VIX Flip strategy can be used to buy stocks that

provide buy signals.

• The strategy could also be used to buy call options.

• The strategy could be useful for selling put options.

• Put prices are elevated when VIX Flip is high and the
underlying stock is likely to rise when the buy signal
occurs, offering two profit opportunities.

111


Put/Call Ratio

Ratio =

Total Volume Of Puts Traded

Total Volume Of Calls Traded

• As this ratio increases, investors are putting their money

into put options rather than call options.

• An increase in put options signals investors are either

starting to speculate that the market will move lower, or
starting to hedge their portfolios in case of a sell-off.

• Either way, the increase in puts is a contrarian buy signal.

Put-Call Ratio Can Signal Turning Points in Price

• Reached a value of 0.70 at March 2009 low

• In week before December 2018 low, the value ranged from 1.02 to

1.89.

• Effectiveness of this indicator, and others based on how markets

trade, evolved over time.

• In 1993, Stock Market Logic cited this as the most sensitive market timing

tool available with buy signals below 35% and sell signals near 140%.

• The ratio has not been below 0.55 since at least 2006

114


Commitment of Traders (COT) Data

• COT data is published weekly by the Commodity Futures

Trading Commission (CFTC).

• To draw valid conclusions from the CFTC reports, we
need to compare current positions to their historical
norms.

• All open interest (OI) is assigned to one of three groups:

Hedgers, Large Speculators or Small Speculators.

115


COT Data Breakdown

• Commercials are producers and large users who hedge

their needs.

• As a group, commercials have inside information and

are well-capitalized.

• Important insights can be gained from their actions

because they are successful in the long run.

• They often short futures because many own physical

commodities.

• Large specs are usually commodity funds, generally trend-

followers who do poorly as a group.

• Small specs are the proverbial “dumb money” of the

markets and are usually long, reflecting their perennial
optimism.

116

118


Raw Data Is Volatile

• Raw data is also difficult to interpret.

• In some markets commercials will be short most of the time.

• This can be overcome by converting data to an index:

• Look back period could be 3 years, 26 weeks of some other period.

• Multiplied by 100 to express value as a percentage.

119


Raw Data and Indexed Data

120


Advisory Opinion

• Advisory opinion indicators covers newsletter writers.

• The widespread belief is that writers follow trends out
of fear of losing subscribers by missing major moves.
• According to Elder (Trading for a Living), “bullishness

helps sell subscriptions, while bearish comments turn off
subscribers. Even in a bear market, we rarely see more
bears than bulls among advisors for more than a few
weeks at a time.”

• Advisory opinion is most bullish at market tops and most

bearish at market bottoms.

• When the mass of letter writers turns strongly bullish or
bearish, this indicator says to look for trend reversals.

Magazine Covers

• Skewed sentiment is an important coincident indicator at

market turns.

• By definition, financial markets are most bullishly

optimistic at major tops and most bearishly pessimistic at
major bottoms.

• Magazine covers can act as a sentiment thermometer at

market turns of different time constants.

• Anecdotally useful sometimes.

Margin Debt

• Margin debt is debt a brokerage customer takes on by trading on

margin.

• Increases leverage and potential returns and risks.

• A customer may also borrow a security to short sell, rather than

borrowing money with which to buy a security.

• Changes in margin debt can precede trend reversals.

Short interest

• Exchanges report the number of shares sold short for any stock.

• Absolute numbers vary a great deal so it’s often expressed as

• Short Percent of Float: the number of shares sold short divided
by that stock’s float. Higher % indicates sentiment is bearish
and is a contrarian buy signal.

• Days to Cover: the number of shares sold short divided by the
average daily volume. High values are a contrarian buy signal.

• High short interest can lead to panic during rallies, a process

known as a “short squeeze”.

137


Can Hold At High Levels for Extended Periods of
Time

138


Short Interest Can Increase For Several Reasons

• Could indicate short positions are being opened.

• Could reflect market making activities.

• Put-call parity says a call plus cash is equivalent to a

shares of the stock and a put.

• Options could be used to provide liquidity.

• Could reflect hedging activities.

AAII Survey

• This indicator is a compilation of a survey of about 170,000

AAII members. They are asked about their six-month market
outlook. Sample size is generally 300 self-selected
respondents in any given week.

• Used as a contrarian indicator.

Trading by Insiders

• Officers and investors who hold more than 10% of outstanding

shares must report buys and sells to the SEC (SEC Form 4)
• Corporate insiders have a long record of buying stocks when

they're cheap and selling them high.

• Insider buying emerges after severe market drops, and insider

selling accelerates when the market rallies and becomes
overpriced.

• Buying or selling by a single insider is not significant, an executive
may sell shares to meet major personal expenses or may buy to
exercise stock options.

• Generally meaningful only if 3 or more executives or large

stockholders bought or sold within a month.

• Clusters of insider buying tend to have a better predictive value

than clusters of selling

143


Learning Objectives

• Sentiment (CBOE volatility index (VIX), surveys, insider

buying and selling)

• Breadth (advance decline, % stocks above a moving

average)

144


The Concept of Market Breadth

• Market breadth measure the level of participation in a

market trend.

• Indexes like the S&P 500 include only a small number

of stocks that are traded on an exchange.

• Breadth indicators, like the advance-decline line, are

based on the price action of each individual stock that is
traded to see whether they are confirming the trend
seen in the index.

• Breadth indicators are generally based on diffusion

indexes with each stock being given an equal weight in the
calculation.

145


Breadth Analysis

• Breadth either confirms or diverges from the price action.
• Confirmation occurs when both price and the indicator

makes new highs or new lows.

• Divergences occur when only price or the indicator
makes a new high or low and the other does not.

• Bullish divergence: indicator makes a higher high while

price is making lows.

• Bearish divergence: indicator fails to surpass a previous

high while price does.

• Many technicians believe breadth will diverge at

important turning points.

146


Strength in Numbers

• The idea behind breadth indicators is that a general cannot win a

war by himself.

• A leader needs a number of troops behind him in order to make

long-term progress.

• Without the large following, a single leader is unlikely to hold any

gains they make.

• In the markets, a few stocks can lead an index higher even while
the majority of stocks are declining. Breadth indicators would
capture this divergence and show that the bullish movement of the
index is not broadly based in the market.

147


Changes In Breadth May Signal Ahead of the Price
Action

• Breadth should ideally confirm the trend.

• If the price of an index is rising, breadth indicators should be

moving up.

• If an index is falling, breadth should be declining.

• Breadth can diverge for a significant time period.

• In the internet bubble (1999/2000) some breadth indicators

turned bearish two years before the top.

148


Divergences Are Not a Precise Timing Tool

149


The Advance-Decline (A/D) Line

• A/D line shows broad market trends.

• A/D line confirms trends or diverges from trend using all stocks

rather than just leaders

• Calculation:

Advances = number of stocks that closed up
Decliners = number of stocks that closed lower

Advancers - Decliners

• Ignore unchanged stocks.

152


New Highs and New Lows As a Breadth Indicator

• Calculated as:

NH-NL = New Highs − New Lows

• Plotted as a histogram with a center line at zero.

• When NHs > NLs, value is positive.
• When NHs < NLs, value is negative.

• Compares the numbers of the strongest and the weakest stocks on
the exchange to show the balance of power between the leaders in
strength and the leaders in weakness.

• Divergences and crossovers of zero line offer trading signals.

153


Divergence Was Visible at 2009 Bottom

154


Stocks Above 50-day MA

• This indicator counts the number of stocks above the MA.

• When the market is trending higher, the percentage of

stocks above their moving averages keeps growing

• In a broad downtrend, the number of stocks above their

MAs keeps shrinking

155

Breadth Indicator vs. SP500

• In the past twelve years, being out of  the market when %stocks

on MACD buy signals is below 50 avoided steep losses.
• Max loss was 14.2%.
• Max loss for S&P 500 over that time was 56%.

159


Other Breadth Indicators

• Advance-Decline Volume Line – Based on the volume of

advancing and declining issues. Slightly more complex than A/D
line alone.

• Arms Index (TRIN) – Based on the advance-decline (A/D) Ratio

and A/D Volume Ratio. Combines the concepts of the A/D line and
A/D volume line.

• Bullish Percent Index – Based on the percentage of stocks on point

& figure chart buy signals. Could be for a sector, index or
exchange.

RSI vs RS

• RSI is the more popular indicator.
• Widely available on web sites.
• Developed for commodity markets.
• Uses 14-days in calculation because this is equal to about ½ of the
lunar cycle and Wilder believed commodities were influenced by
the lunar cycle.

• RS is more difficult to calculate and is not widely available.

• Widely used by professional investors. Head of technical analysis

research at Fidelity said “I’d never look at a chart without a relative
strength line.”

• Explained by Robert Rhea in 1933, refined by Gartley (1945), Levy

(1967), Fama and French (1992) and many others.

• In academic community, RS is commonly called the “momentum

anomaly to the efficient market hypothesis.”

• Calculated with data looking back 3-12 months; calculated in a

variety of ways but a very robust indicator.

167


What Is Relative Strength?

• The winner in any game is relatively stronger than the loser.

• Research proves the team ahead early in the game has an

advantage:

• In hockey, the team ahead after 1 period wins 67% of the time.

• In baseball, the team ahead after 3 innings win 80% of the time.

• Basketball: the team ahead by 4 at halftime wins 60% of the

time; teams up by 6 at halftime wins 80% of the time.

100 Runners at the Start of a Race: How Can We Pick a
Likely Winner?

• First, define “winner.”

• In a race, the winner is the individual who finishes

first.

• In the stock market, a winner is a stock that performs

better than average.

• In a 100-stock race, there will be 49 winners with

this definition.

• We can narrow this definition to the top 10% or

the top 25% or some other percentage.

169


Picking a Winner: Understand What You Know

• In a race, you know the past performance of runners.

• You can make this more complex and add performance under
different weather conditions or elevation above sea level or
based on the age of the runner’s shoes or any other variable.

• Other than past performance, you don’t know anything.

• Everything besides performance is a guess based on what you

don’t know.

170


With Stocks, We Know Very Little

• We know past performance.
• Some investors believe they know the company’s financials, but,

financials can be, and often are, restated or revised.

About 59.1% of the
restatements had no
impact on earnings.

171


Back to the Runners and the Race

• We know:

• 100 runners are starting and we have the past performance of

all runners.

• We define winning as selecting, in advance, a runner who finishes

in the top 10%.

• We can diversify and select 10 runners to bet on.

172


Who Would You Bet On?

• Many will pick the best bet is to pick the top 10% based on past

performance.

• Some bettors will always want to go with the long shot.

• They are destined to lose more often than they win.

• They are also likely to buy lottery tickets.

173


Applying Past Performance to Stocks

• Past performance can be measured.

• Stock prices tend to move in trends.

• Relative winners in past six months tend to outperform in next

six and vice versa.

174


RS Is Recognized as the Momentum Anomaly to the
EMH

• Supported by academic research:

• Levy (1967) demonstrated persistence of price trends over 26-
week timeframe could be used to develop profitable trading
strategies.

• Jegadeesh & Titman (1993) found profitable strategies using RS

measurements over 3- to 12-months.

175


Applying RS

• Calculate a measure of RS for each stock.

• Sort and rank all stocks by that measure.

• Buy the top performers.

• Short the worst performers.

• RS consistently outperforms the broad stock market.

• Independent of calculation method.
• Time frames from 3 months to 12 months generally

work in calculations.

176


Calculations for RS

• Common methods include:

• Rate of Change, often 6 months or 26 weeks.

• ROC can exclude the most recent month or 4 weeks.

• Price/Moving Average Ratios as Levy used in 1967

paper.

• Value Line Timeliness rank uses a ratio of ROC

calculations.

• IBD provides a measure of RS using 4 quarters

overweighting the most recent quarter.

177


Portfolios Need to Be Reviewed Periodically

• New sorts should be done periodically.

• Can be done weekly, yearly or any time period in between.

• Stocks falling below a rank (such as 70) should be sold and

replaced with the highest ranked stocks.

178


Comparative RS

• A simple ratio comparing the price action of two securities

or of one security to the broad market.

179


RS Can Be Used To Confirm Trends

180


Benefits of RS Strategies

• RS can be used to identify stocks that are likely to outperform the

market over the next 3-6 months.

• RS can be used to find the best trade candidates among a group of

stocks.

• RS can be applied to pairs trading.

• RS avoids market laggards and can help investors avoid value

traps.

181


Avoiding Laggards By Spotting Value Traps

182


An Alternative RS Formula: New High RS

• Express the current price as a percentage of the 52-week

high:

Close / 52-week high

• This represents where the price is relative to the past year.

• Builds on the work of George and Hwang in 2004 Journal

of Finance article, The 52 Week High and Momentum
Investing.

183


RS Strategy

• Add a 26-week moving average to the New High RS

indicator:

• Buy when indicator > MA.
• Sell when indicator < MA.

• The absolute value of the indicator isn’t important, the

position relative to the MA is what we trade.

184


Examples

• In the following slides, the NH RS indicator is shown at

the bottom of the chart with its MA.

• The middle of the chart shows a MACD calculation of RS.

• NH RS is generally more responsive.

187


Avoids Big Losses

188


Testing

• These tests apply a moving average to the indicator.

• MA tests always have low win rates.

• They do find all big winners and they do avoid all large

losses.

• But, MA systems have low win rates because of small,
whipsaw trades that are inevitable as a trend develops.

• To improve win rates, consider requiring delaying action

for 2-3 weeks (this is a weekly indicator).

• Require two weeks of “buy” signals before buying and
delaying selling until two consecutive weeks of “sell”
signals are given.

189


Testing Results

• Using the stocks in the S&P 500 from 1/1/2000 through

9/30/2017, deducting $5 per trade for commissions.

• Win rate: 36.7%.

• Average annual return: 16.9%.

• S&P 500 average annual return = 6.1%.

• Max drawdown: 16%.

• S&P 500 max drawdown = 55%.

• Invested about 30% of the time and can use other

strategies the rest of the time

Use Fundamentals First

• Quantitative Strategies for Achieving Alpha by Richard Tortoriello.

• Selecting stocks by valuation first improves excess returns.

• For example, the free cash flow to price and seven-month relative
strength strategy resulted in excess returns of 9.5% for the top
quintile and -8.6% for the bottom; consistency is high and
volatility (of the top quintile) is low.

• “Valuation and price momentum make a natural pair, since valuation

factors identify stocks that are “cheap,” while price momentum
indicates that investors may see a catalyst (fundamental or otherwise)
likely to turn the stock around.”

198


Why Does RS Matter?

• From Tortoriello:

So-called “value” stocks often stay cheap for a long time. On the
other hand, stocks with high price momentum sometimes sport very
high valuations and are subject to significant declines on minor
disappointments. The combination of valuation and price
momentum ensures that a stock has both value and the potential for
near-term price appreciation.

Learning Objectives

• Dow theory
• Cycle analysis
• Elliott wave theory
• Fibonacci sequence
• Intermarket analysis

201


Dow Theory

• Use only two indexes:

• The Dow Jones Industrial Average – thirty stocks.
• The Dow Jones Transportation Average – twenty

stocks.

• Plot only closing prices.

• Dow said “the most important price of the day is the

close.”

• The two averages must confirm each other’s direction.

202


Dow Jones Industrial Average

• Created by Charles Dow. First calculated in 1896.

• Originally created to track economic activity.

• Consisted of 12 companies.
• Now includes 30.

• Second oldest stock market index.
• Transports is the oldest index.

• Now one of the most widely followed indexes in the world.

203


Dow Jones Transportation Average

• Created to track railroad stocks which were then the most
important sector in the economy and the stock market.

• First calculated in 1884.

• Originally included 11 companies (9 railroads, a steamship

company and Western Union).

• Now includes 20 transportation companies (railroads,
trucking companies, airlines, delivery companies and
rental services).

204


Dow Theory Principles

1. The market has three movements.

2. Market trends have three phases.

3. Markets discount the news.

4. The averages must confirm each other.

5. Trends are confirmed by volume.

6. Trends exist until definitive signals confirm the trend

has reversed.

205


Dow Theory Principles
1. The market has three movements

1. The Primary Tide is the major long-term trend.
2. A Secondary Reaction is the intermediate-term.

corrections that interrupt and move in an opposite
direction against the Primary Tide.

3. Minor day-to-day fluctuations known as Ripples are

smaller price moves that are of no concern to
interpreting Dow Theory.

206


Dow Theory Principles
2. Market trends have three phases

• For uptrends:

1. Accumulation or smart money accumulating stocks

when the economy is bad but expected to improve.

2. Recognition occurs as individual investors buy
stocks as economic news and earnings improve.
3. Speculation occurs when the general public notices
that all the financial news is good and begins buying
to avoid missing out.

207


Dow Theory Principles
2. Market trends have three phases

• Downtrends:

1. Distribution as smart money sells because they realize

high valuations and good economic news can’t continue
forever.

2. Fear develops as stocks fall and fearful individual

investors sell after suffering losses on stocks they bought
in the speculation stage.

3. Capitulation is the final down move that develops when

investors are disgusted by the stock market.

208


Dow Theory
3. Markets discount the news

• Market prices reflect what is known (as Schabacker noted
in 1930 fundamentals are reflected in technical action).

• Market prices change in response to news.

• This principle of Dow Theory is similar to the Efficient
Market Hypothesis (EMH) which was developed in the
1960s.

209


Dow Theory Principles
4. The averages must confirm each other

• For a Bull Market, both Averages must rise above previous

highs which were set before the most  recent reactions.
• To signal a Bear Market, both Averages must drop below
their respective lows reached in the previous secondary
reactions.

• A move to a new high or new low by just one Average does

not change the direction of the primary trend.
• Dow Theory does not stipulate any time limit on

confirmation by both Averages.

210


Dow Theory Principles
5. Trends are confirmed by volume

• Dow believed that volume confirmed price trends.

• Not all analysts consider volume when interpreting Dow

Theory.

• Volume indicators may not be as relevant in modern
markets since traders can use options, futures and
other derivatives to establish positions.

211


Dow Theory Principles
6. Trends exist until definitive signals confirm the
trend has reversed

• Only end-of-day, closing prices are considered. Intraday

prices are ignored.

• This ignores the ripples.

• Both averages must reverse before a new signal is given.

Market Cycles Differ From Mathematical Cycles

• Cycles in math are well-defined.

• Market cycles are imprecise and will not behave as a well-

defined mathematical cycle.

• Cycles in the markets are a guide rather than a roadmap to

the future.

216


Defining Market Cycles

• Cycles are a recurring phenomena with three qualities:

• Amplitude.
• Period.
• Phase.

• Amplitude measures the height of the wave that defines

the cycle.

• Period is the time between cycle troughs (bottoms).

• Analysts generally measure cycle lengths from bottom

to bottom rather than with crests (tops).

• Phase is the measure of how far a cycle is from its previous

trough.

217

219


Business Cycle (Charted With the Unemployment
Rate)

220


Belief in Business Cycles Dates Back to at Least the
1800s

• William Stanley Jevons published General Mathematical Theory

of Political Economy in 1862, outlining the marginal utility
theory of value.

• Jevons found the economy seemed to oscillate between booms and

busts in a rather predictable 10-year cycle.

• “Assuming that variations of commercial credit and enterprise are

essentially mental in their nature, must there not be external
events to excite hopefulness at one time and disappointment and
despondency at another?”

• “I can see no reason why the human mind, in its own spontaneous

action, should select a period of just 10.44 years to vary in.”

• “The Solar Period and the Price of Corn” was published in 1875
and refined in other articles including “Commercial Crises and
Sunspots”.

221


Basic Principles of Cycles

• Summation: price movements are the sum of all cycles.
• Harmonicity: neighboring waves are usually multiples of

each other.

• For a 20-day cycle, there should be a 10-day cycle and a

40-day cycle present in the data.

• Synchronicity: waves tend to bottom at about the same

time.

• A 10-day, 20-day and 40-cycle should all bottom

around the same day.

• Proportionality: cycles with longer lengths should have
proportionally greater amplitudes than short-period
cycles.

• Expect a 20-day cycle to have an amplitude 2x greater

than a 10-day cycle.

222


Seasonal Patterns in the Markets

• Seasonality is a cycle that occurs in line with the calendar.

• One example is associated with the planting and harvesting of

crops, which directly affect the feeding and marketing of livestock.
Normally, prices are higher when a product is not as readily
available.

• Consumer habits can cause a seasonal pattern in airline travel or

gasoline prices.

• Seasonals are also found in stocks and fixed income investments

and are longer than a year at times.

223

Prices don’t always match the seasonal pattern

Market Cycles: Ten-Year Cycles

226

227


Market Cycle: Annual Cycle

228


Popular Seasonals

• Six Best Months to own stocks, a time period that starts in
November and runs through April. Known as “Sell in May.”

• January Effect is a tendency for small cap and value stocks to

outperform large cap and growth stocks in the first month of the
year.

• Holiday Seasonality: buy stocks two days before a holiday and sell

at the open the day the market reopens after the holiday. This
strategy offers low risk since you are rarely invested but its returns
were 17 times higher than a buy and hold approach according to
Fosback in Stock Market Logic..

• Fourth Quarter Rally in stocks occurs 72% of the time.

229


To Identify a Potential Cycle, Remove the
Trend From A Price Series

• With the deviation from the mean method:

• Find the first differences of log values (subtract the
previous value from the current value) and then
subtract the difference from the 1-year average.

• This can be done with a periodogram.

• More advanced methods include the Hilbert Transform

and Fisher Transform.

• Data mining: enter on a day and exit x-days later.
• Can also use a triangular moving average.

234


Elliott Wave Principle

• Developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott (1871 – 1948)

• Based on the belief that the market has structure and that structure

can be seen in cycles that follow a general pattern.

• Prices move in waves.
• Waves can be motive (impulsive) or corrective.
• The motive waves are the stronger movement of the trend.
• Corrective waves are the countertrend moves that interrupt the

motive wave.

235


Elliott Waves

• Bull markets

• 5 waves up in impulse waves
• 3 waves down in corrective

waves

• Bear markets

• 5 waves down in impulse
• 3 waves up in corrective

waves

236


Impulse Waves and Corrective Waves

• Waves 1, 3 and 5 are impulse waves.
Motive waves move the price in the
direction of the primary trend.

• Waves 2 and 4 are corrective waves.

•

Impulse waves breakdown into
smaller moves of 5 waves (1,2,3,4,5).

• Corrective waves breakdown into
smaller moves of 3 wave (a,b,c).

237


Basic Rules

238


Important Elements of the Elliott Wave Theory

• Every wave has a starting point and ending point in price

and time.

• The pattern is continuous in that the end of one wave

marks the beginning of the next wave.

• The basic pattern consists of  five individual waves that

are linked together.

• Waves are fractal, meaning they are part of larger waves

and can be subdivided into smaller waves.

Useful guidelines

• Equality: Wave 5 should approximately equal Wave 1 if Wave 3 is
the longest. Remember, Wave 3 cannot be the shortest but it can
be equal to Wave 1. If 3 = 1, expect 5 to be the longest.

• After a 5-wave impulse advance, corrections (a-b-c) usually end in

the area of prior Wave 4 low.

242


Wave Guidelines

• Alternation: the forms for Wave 2 and Wave 4 will

alternate. If Wave 2 is a sharp correction, Wave 4 will be a
flat correction. If Wave 2 is flat, Wave 4 will be sharp.

243


Extensions

• One wave often subdivides into five parts providing a

count of 9 instead of 5 in the primary direction.

244


Truncated Fifth Waves

• Truncation occurs when the fifth wave does not move
beyond the end of the third. Truncation often occurs
following an extensively strong third wave.

247


Motive Waves: Diagonal Waves

• A Diagonal Wave is the second type of motive wave. It moves

prices in the direction of the primary trend and consists of five
subwaves.

• The difference is that the diagonal looks like a wedge, either
expanding or contracting, while impulse waves form parallel
channels.

• Sub-waves of the diagonal may not have a count of five.

Source: StockCharts.com

248


Motive Waves: Diagonal Waves

• They are the only five-wave structures in the direction of

the main trend within which wave 4 almost always
overlaps wave 1.

Source: Elliott Wave International

249


Corrective Waves: Zigzags

• A single zigzag in a bull market is a simple 3-wave declining

pattern labeled A-B-C and subdividing 5-3-5.

• The top of wave B is noticeably lower than the start of wave A.

Source: StockCharts.com

250


Corrective Waves: Zigzags

•

• Occasionally zigzags will occur twice, or at most, three times in succession.
• This usually occurs when the first zigzag falls short of a normal target.
In these cases, each zigzag is separated by an intervening "three" (labeled X),
producing what is called a double zigzag or triple zigzag. The zigzags are
labeled W and Y (and Z, if a triple).

Source: Elliott Wave International

251


Corrective Waves: Flat Corrections

• A flat correction differs from a zigzag in that the
subwave sequence is 3-3-5.  A zigzag is 5-3-5.

Source: StockCharts.com

252


Corrective Waves: Flat Corrections

• Since the first actionary wave, wave A, lacks sufficient downward

force to unfold into a full five waves as it does in a zigzag, the B wave
reaction seems to inherit this lack of countertrend pressure and, not
surprisingly, terminates near the start of wave A.

• Wave C, in turn, generally terminates just slightly beyond the end of

wave A rather than significantly beyond as in zigzags.

• Flat corrections usually retrace less of preceding impulse waves than

do zigzags.

• The more powerful the underlying trend, the briefer the flat tends to

be. Within impulses, fourth waves frequently sport flats, while
second waves rarely do.

253


Corrective Waves: Flat Corrections

• Three types of 3-3-5 corrections have been identified by

differences in their overall shape.

• In a regular flat correction, wave B terminates about at the level of
the beginning of wave A, and wave C terminates a slight bit past
the end of wave A.

Source: Elliott Wave International

254


Corrective Waves: Flat Corrections

• More common is the expanded flat, which contains a price

extreme beyond that of the preceding impulse wave.

• In expanded flats, wave B of the 3-3-5 pattern terminates beyond
the starting level of wave A, and wave C ends more substantially
beyond the ending level of wave A.

Source: Elliott Wave International

255


Corrective Waves: Horizontal Triangles

• Triangles are overlapping with 5 waves that subdivide

3-3-3-3-3.

• They appear to reflect a balance of forces, causing a
sideways movement that is usually associated with
decreasing volume and volatility.

Source: StockCharts.com

256


Corrective Waves: Horizontal Triangles

• Triangles nearly always occur in positions prior to the
final actionary wave in the pattern of one larger degree.
• They are seen as wave four in an impulse, wave B in an
A-B-C, or the final wave X in a double or triple zigzag
or combination.

Running Triangle

257


Corrective Waves: Horizontal Triangles

•
In addition to a running triangle, regular triangles can also form.
• Regular triangles form within the area of preceding price action.
• This differs from a running triangle where wave b exceeds the start of

wave a.

Source: Elliott Wave
International

258


Corrective Waves: Combinations

• Elliott called sideways combinations of corrective patterns “double threes"

and “triple threes."

• A single three is any zigzag, flat or triangle.
• A double or triple three is a combination of simpler types of corrections,

including the various types of zigzags, flats and triangles. Their occurrence
appears to be the flat correction's way of extending sideways action.

Source: StockCharts.com

259


Corrective Waves: Combinations

• Double and triple threes are horizontal in character.
• There is never more than one zigzag in a combination.
• There is never more than one triangle in a combination.
• Triangles occurring alone precede the final movement of a larger

trend (wave 4).

• Combinations appear to recognize this character and triangles occur

only as the final wave in a double or triple three.

263


Fibonacci Sequence

• A numerical sequence attributed to Leonardo “Fibonacci” Pisano (c.

1175 – c. 1250):

• Suppose a newly-born pair of rabbits, one male, one female, are

put in a field. Rabbits are able to mate at the age of one month so
that at the end of its second month a female can produce another
pair of rabbits. Suppose that our rabbits never die and that the
female always produces one new pair (one male, one female) every
month from the second month on. The question Fibonacci asked
was “How many pairs will there be in one year?”

264


How Many Rabbits?

1. At the end of the first month, they mate, but there is still one

only 1 pair.

2. At the end of the second month the female produces a new pair,

so now there are 2 pairs of rabbits in the field.

3. At the end of the third month, the original female produces a

second pair, making 3 pairs in all in the field.

4. At the end of the fourth month, the original female has

produced yet another new pair, the female born two months ago
produces her first pair also, making 5 pairs.

• To solve the problem for the next month, add the last number to

the previous number:

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987

The Golden Ratio

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987

• Ratio of any number to the next higher number in the sequence is

0.618 (21/34 = 0.6176).

• Ratio to the next higher number is 0.382 (21/55 = 0.382).

• Ratio of any number to the next lower number in the sequence is

1.618 (55/34 = 1.6176).

• Traders look for price moves related to 38.2% and 61.8% along

with extensions.

Fibonacci Retracement

• Fibonacci retracements are used to estimate points where

pullbacks are likely to reverse. If prices move up by 100 points, we
expect a retracement to stop after a decline of 38 points or 62
points.

John Murphy Introduced the Idea of Intermarket
Analysis in 1991

• “The whole idea of the book is that all these markets are related.
For example, if you're trading the stock market, you also have to
follow bonds, since what happens in the bond market has an
impact on stocks. And bonds are very much affected by commodity
prices.”

• “For example, when commodities turn up, that's an early sign of
inflation. Commodities' turning up pushes interest rates higher,
and, in time, that becomes bearish for stocks. Now what pushes
commodity prices higher is the falling dollar. You can't look at any
one of these markets all by itself—you have to understand the
impact they have on one another. ”

General Concept of Intermarket Analysis

• All markets are related and analysts can gain valuable insights

into one market by studying the trends in other markets.

• Intermarket analysis can be used to confirm trends or identify

divergences. Markets used are:

• Currencies.
• Commodities.
• Bonds.
• Stocks.

• Relationships of important markets depend on the level of

inflation or deflation.

277


Key Relationships

278


In an Inflationary Environment

• A POSITIVE relationship between bonds and stocks.

• Both move in the same direction as interest rates rise (bond

prices fall) and higher rates hurt stocks.

• Bonds usually change direction ahead of stocks.

• An INVERSE relationship between bonds and commodities.

• Both move in opposite directions as higher interest rates are

associated with higher commodity prices.

• An INVERSE relationship between the US Dollar and commodities.
• Move in opposite directions as rising commodity prices force

dollars into producing countries and US prints money.

279


In a Deflationary Environment

• An INVERSE relationship between bonds and stocks.

• Move in opposite directions as falling interest rates (bonds prices

rising) indicates slowing economy which lowers earnings.

• An INVERSE relationship between bonds and commodities.

• Both move in opposite directions as lower interest rates are

associated with lower commodity prices.

• A POSITIVE relationship between stocks and commodities.

• Move in the same direction as lower commodity prices show

reduced economic growth.

• An INVERSE relationship between the US Dollar and commodities.
• Move in opposite directions as falling commodity prices reduces

need to create dollars.

280


Since Murphy

• Correlation analysis has become more widely accepted as the

means to analyze intermarket relationships.

281


Signals From Correlation Data

Can be considered tradable when greater 0.70 or less than -0.70.

282


Correlations Can Provide Trading Strategies

• Can be used for hedging, pairs trading, or to overcome

liquidity constraints.

• If high, negative correlation exists, the stronger security

could be bought and the weaker sold short.

• If high, positive correlation exists, a more liquid asset

could be subsisted for a less liquid asset.

• Should be recalculated periodically, maybe every six

months, since correlations change.

283


Module 8

Trading Psychology

284


Learning Objectives

• Provide details on behaviors associated with successful

and unsuccessful trading.

285


Psychology of Trading

• Typical discussion includes ideas such as:

• Many traders suffer from either fear of failure or fear of

success and either can lead to low profits and large
losses.

• These problems can be overcome with discipline that

includes a trading plan and a complete strategy
expressed with rules.

• Instead of defining success in terms of profits, consider
defining a successful day as one where you followed
your rules.

286


Problems With the Typical Approach

• Success needs to measured in terms of profits.

• Although it is nice to win, success should not be measured

in terms of an arbitrary win rate.

• Anecdotally, an old floor trader typically made the most

money when he was right about 40% of the time.

• When he was right 45% or more of the time, he wasn’t

accepting enough risk.

• When he was right 35% or less, he was accepting too

much risk.

287


Popular Belief Is that Traders Are Psychopaths

• “The Wisdom of Psychopaths” by Dr. Kevin Dutton

(Oxford psychologist).

• The traits which make a person psychopathic are often
found in highly successful people including CEOs and
investment managers.

• Many people have some of these traits, he says.

288


Key Traits of Psychopaths

• Ruthlessness.
• Intense capacity to focus, excluding all distractions such as fear.
• Powerful reward motivation.
• A disposition to action.
• Acute ability to read emotions in other people, without being

moved by them.

• Charisma.
• Mental resilience.
• Mindfulness, the ability to live in the present moment.

289


The Wisdom of Psychopaths

• Those who can turn them on and off according to

circumstance have a powerful toolkit for doing well in life,
particularly in high-risk, high-reward professions.

• Those with only partial control of such traits, or who have

them jammed full-on all the time, may severely hurt
others, ruin their own business or even damage the world
economy.

• Those who lack any such traits should try to embrace a

few, Dutton suggests.

290


Key Traits Applied to Traders

• Intense capacity to focus, excluding all distractions such

as fear.

• This makes it possible to follow a trading plan.

• A disposition to action.

• This avoids paralysis when facing fast-moving markets.

• Acute ability to read emotions in other people.
• Avoids getting caught up in group think.

291


Key Traits Applied to Traders

• Charisma.

• More useful for managers raising funds.

• Mental resilience.

• Can shake off losses.

• Mindfulness, the ability to live in the present moment.

• Can shake off losses.

292


These Traits Are Found in Other Professions

• CEOs ranked highest in one test.

• Followed by lawyers, TV and radio workers, salespeople,

surgeons and journalists.

• Some of these traits are similar to those exhibited by

experts in Buddhist meditation.

• Both are very good at reading emotions in people’s
faces, embracing new experiences, remaining in the
moment and practicing detachment.

293


The Mental Edge in Trading

• Study by Dr. Jason Williams, MD, found that any type of

personality can succeed.

• Broad recommendations:

• Strive to be aware of thoughts, emotions and actions

and consider how they are interrelating and driving ne
another at any given time.

• Understanding your subconscious is impossible. Trying
to control the conscious mind (thoughts, emotions and
actions) is difficult enough and is all that is needed for
success.

294


General Insights from Williams

• “Your brain’s reward center is designed to trick you into thinking
that pleasures will be more enjoyable than the anticipation of
them. This is an extremely strong reinforcing pathway and can be
very problematic for some traders.”

• This is reinforced by research into behavioral economics and

prospect theory.

• Prospect theory is reviewed in the next section.

• Personality is shaped by genetics and experience, especially that
occurred while your brain is developing (up until your early 20s).

• You cannot alter your personality but you can understand it and

adapt to your personality.

295


Important Personality Traits

• Neuroticism and extraversion are the two most important traits.

• Traits are enduring, pervasive and distinctive.
• There are other traits.

• Broadly, neuroticism deals with the strength and depths of

emotional responses to triggers.

• It especially related to negative emotions (anger, anxiety, guilt

and depression).

• A more neurotic person responds more intensely.

• Broadly, extraversion refers to the speed at which someone

experiences their emotional reactions, and in particular, positive
emotions.

• It means emotions come on rapidly in response to triggers and

the emotions dissipate rapidly.

296


Personal Inventory Tests Are Often Used

• Myers-Briggs

• Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)

• Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R)

• The one preferred by Williams.
• Measures:

• Neuroticism
• Extraversion
• Openness
• Agreeableness
• Conscientiousness

297


Neuroticism (N)

• High N experiences strong and deep emotion.

• Very high N prone to chronic negative emotions and tend to cope

with stress poorly, tend to have low impulse control and have
trouble accepting criticism.

• Low N is emotionally stable.

• Very low N can have too much emotional control and “miss out on

life and tend to repel others.”

298


Extraversion (E)

• High E (extroverts) prefer groups and may have difficulty

functioning on their own. They like excitement.

• Very high E may talk too much, be prone to reckless excitement

seeking and attention seeking behaviors,

• Low E (introverts) may be slow to react and have a tendency to

reflect on the past and plan for the future.

• Very low E can have social isolation abd interpersonal detachment.

299


Openness (O)

• High O are intellectually curious and open to new experiences.

• Very high O can be prone to accepting false ideas (UFO

conspiracies).

• Low O is associated with rigid routines and conventional ideas.

• Very low O are uncreative and unimaginative.

300


Agreeableness (A)

• High A are trusting and altruistic people.

• Very high A can be gullible.

• Low A are skeptical and suspicious and often egocentric.

• Very low A is associated with exploitative and manipulative

behavior.

301


Conscientiousness (C)

• High C people are noted for orderliness and punctuality and

associated with high levels of academic and professional success.

• Very high C can be fastidious and compulsive overachievers who

can be overly rigid.

• Low C is associated with poor planning and poor self control.

• Very low C tend to have poor academic and professional

accomplishments and are undisciplined.

302


Personality Is More Nuanced Than Those
Dimensions

• There are other facets to personality. For example, under

N are facets of:

• Anxiety
• Anger
• Depression
• Self-consciousness
• Impulsivity
• Vulnerability

• The facets are identified in the tests.

303


Neuroticism and Trading

• The best traders have low anxiety. But, understanding that you

suffer from high anxiety means it can be overcome.

• If you have low N, you will not take wins or losses personally.

• High N traders must understand they can be subject to emotional

swings.

• They may get angry and double down or skip trades.
• They may want to avoid high frequency strategies since they would

do best allowing time to reset their emotions between trades.

• A journal could help identify emotional responses and reflection
could result in strategy adjustments (like taking time between
trades).

304


Minimizing Anxiety-Induced Errors

• Set realistic goals since anxiety will increase if you miss lofty goals.

• Avoid setting goals in dollar terms.

• Avoid “I will make $3,000,000 in profits this year or $250,000 per

month.”

• Consider process goals.

• I will make X entries this month and monitor open positions Y times per

day.

305


Consider How Self-Conscious and Vulnerable You
Are

• If you are high in these facets, it can be difficult to confront losses

or admit losses to others.

• Could result in a fear of losing money that leads to large losses.

• May avoid directional market calls because of fear of being wrong.

• Desire to be right could result in small profits rather than a desire

to maximize gains.

306


Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

• Could help with challenges.

• “The key is to rehearse, over and over, a desired set of positive

emotions, thoughts and behaviors during a period of time you are in a
specific emotional state. It’s the very best way ti teach an old dog new
tricks.”

• Goal is to disrupt the pattern.

• An event triggers a distorted thought (a bad trade results in

thinking “I was dumb”). Thoughts lead to emotions (anger or
depression). Feelings lead to actions (self-destructive behaviors).

307


Four S’s of CBT

• Stop sign: when you sense a negative and untrue thought, imagin

holding up a stop sign.

• Shout it out: self-explanatory and not always practical.

• Substitute: sub affirmations. Instead of “I am an idiot” try “I am a

capable trader who learns from my mistakes.”

• Sustain: react appropriately to all appropriate thoughts.

308


More Advanced CBT Technique

• Choose a strenuous activity like exercising on a treadmill.
• Become aware of physical response to the activity (increased heart

rate and alertness).

• Mentally rehearse the desired behavior (holding onto a winning

trade).

• Frequent repetition conditions the body to respond.
• CBT tempers underlying personality traits so that when stress

develops, you are ready to confront it appropriately.

• Techniques backed by studies.

309


Risk Aversion and Trading

• Openness corresponds well to risk aversion.

• In particular:

• Comfortable with novelty and variety rather than familiar routines

but not unpredictable.

• Open to arguments and enjoy brain teasers which displays they are

curious and willing to consider new ideas.

• Willing to examine social, political and religious values (not

dogmatic or completely lacking in convictions).

• If you score low on this dimension, then you should consider placing
stops that are consistent with your level of risk aversion and using
strategies that match your personality.

310


Conscientiousness and Trading

• Highly conscientious individuals make better system traders while

low levels of this trait make better discretionary traders.

• If you are in the middle, blend the styles.

• Overconfidence can be a problem for traders.

• Many traders feel they are well-prepared and capable rather than

having a tendency to seek perfectionism

311


Optimism and Trading

• Overly optimistic traders may forget about losses too easily.

• They see the world through “rose-colored glasses.

• Overly pessimistic traders tend to doubt themselves.

• Best to recognize both emotional responses can create problems and

build in filters to limit risks.

• Have a long term filter and a short term filter to time trade entries

consistent with long term outlook.

• Consider risks and rewards of a trade, and evaluate the worst case

possibility

312


Excitement Seeking and Trading

• Very high: reckless and dangerous.

• High: crave excitement and stimulation.

• Low: seek boredom.

• Very low: dull and monotonous.

• High levels of excitement seeking can be dangerous to traders.

313


Journals Can Be Helpful

• Journals can force traders to evaluate how they feel in addition to

the profit or loss on a trade.

• Questions could provide a framework for the journal.

• This is not a journal for each trade but a journal of the trading day.

• Could be done periodically rather than continuously.

314


Questions for Journals

1. Did I feel happy or sad while trading today? What was it that

made me feel that way?

2. Did I feel anxious or stressed out while trading today? What

triggered that?

3. Did I feel alert and energetic while trading today? Did I do

anything different today?

4. Did I feel discouraged while trading today? How did I overcome

that feeling?

5. Did I feel capable of succeeding at my trading today?

315


Questions for Journals

6. Did I blame myself today when my trading didn’t work out as
planned? Was I really to blame?

7. Did I feel satisfied with my trading results today? Did I meet my
goals? Did I even have any set goals for today?

8. Did I feel angry, edgy or frustrated while trading today? Who or what
was I angry at? How did I deal with those emotions? Was it healthy
how I dealt with my emotions?

9. Did I feel in control of what happened while trading today? Was it
sustained?

10. Did I make impulsive decisions while trading today?  How could I
have prevented that?

316


Case Studies of Traders

• Low anxiety and low vulnerability are normal. Strong tendency to

take action relative to need for excitement.

• Vulnerability

• Very high scorers are overwhelmed by minor stress and are prone

to panic.

• High scorers are often feel hopeless and dependent on others when

faced with stressful situations.

• Low scorers believe that are capable of handling themselves in

stressful situations.

• Very low scorers feel unrealistically invincible and fail to recognize

their own limitations.

317


Discretionary Traders

• High interest in fantasy or daydreams, rather than preferring to

keep their mind on the task at hand.

• Tend to be interested in art and music.

• Tend to feel both happiness and unhappiness rather than a

blunted range of emotions.
